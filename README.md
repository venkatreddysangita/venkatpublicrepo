### Assumptions and Key Points
OOB features are untouched like forms, views, sitemap etc. so that customization is done for the requirements only
The Solution needs to be tested by assigning the different security roles to users
Users should be have the 'Basic User', 'Customer Service app access' security roles in addition to the custom security roles for testing
Customisation of the 'Resolve' button is done only at the form level and not the home page of Case Entity

Let me know if you want to test in the trial instance that i have created, i can add a new user account for you !
